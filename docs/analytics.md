# Analytics

This is a compilation of documentation available on how different countries approach analytics and telemetry of their apps.

## ENPA

If you are running ENX, please contact your Google and Apple developer relations teams about enrolling in ENPA. For those setting up ENPA, we strongly recommend including the opt-in for analytics to your current app sign-up process, even if you are not yet enrolled in ENPA. Having pre-authorization for anonymous, aggregated analytics will help you collect better information faster so you can adjust your system moving forward.

More information coming soon.
