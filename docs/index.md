# About

Linux Foundation Public Health hosts the [GAEN Implementer's Forum](https://www.lfph.io/community/implementers-forum/), a resource and community designed to help various teams working with Public Health Authorities (PHAs) implementing Google Apple Exposure Notification API (GAEN) apps in their communities.

This resource is designed to help you get access to the wisdom and experience of others working on this same challenge around the world.

# What we offer

* **Private channels on Slack**
    * `#gaen-implementers` is designed to be out of the public eye so that you can have honest conversations with other teams around the world also working on exposure notification.
    * `#gaen-us` is only US-based PHAs
    * `#eu-implementers` is only EU-based PHAs
    * `#gaen-risk-score` is dedicated to figuring out the right levels for risk scores and is especially for our epidemiologists
        * New to Slack? Check out these introductory [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2JuAa6-ors&list=PLWlXaxtQ7fUb1WqLJDqJFGQsAXU7CjoGz&index=2&t=0s) or [documentation](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members).
        * Have a teammate that you want to invite to Slack? They can register at [slack.lfph.io](https://slack.lfph.io) and then message Jenny to get added to private channels.
* **This public documentation site**: This website has the best public material available that we have been able to source. If you have a question and would like to see some additional material up here, we’re happy to add it.
<!-- * Private GitHub repo: If you have information that you only want to share with members of the Implementer’s Forum, we can upload it to a private GitHub repo. However, please note that we can’t guarantee that the files won’t later be distributed to others. Whenever possible, we encourage information to be shared via our public documentation site instead. -->
* [**LFPH Landscape**](https://landscape.lpfh.io): The landscape shows all the current exposure notification apps on the market, with links to their GitHub repositories, marketing websites, and social tmedia accounts.
* [**Monthly webinars**](https://www.lfph.io/community/webinars/): The forum hosts a monthly webinar (more often if there’s interest) on a topic that’s pertinent to the community. They’re designed to be interactive, starting with an introduction to a topic and followed by some group discussion. Notes are posted at [https://github.com/lfph/events](https://github.com/lfph/events).

The team at LFPH is here to support you in any way you need. This can include gathering data, writing up articles, and whatever is otherwise needed to help you out. The only caveat is that, in the spirit of open source, any work LFPH does for your organization needs to be made available to the entire forum (and preferably to be public).
